# TODO / Future Features

## Firefox for Android compatibility

**Goal:** Make the extension installable and usable on Firefox for Android, so the homograph protection extends to mobile browsing.

**What ports for free:** The detection logic itself is platform-agnostic. `webRequest`, `storage`, and the Unicode-script work in `background.js` and `unicode-scripts.js` would behave identically on Android, so the core security value carries over without code changes.

**What needs attention:**

- **Responsive CSS** across `options.html`, `blocked.html`, `warning.html`, and `help.html`. The options page's wide language table, the multi-button rows on the block/warning pages, and the dense whitelist/coloured-squares layouts are all desktop-first and will overflow or wrap badly on narrow screens. Add `@media (max-width: …)` rules to stack buttons vertically, narrow the language table, and reduce padding.
- **`menus` API on Android** — Firefox for Android has no traditional right-click, so the "Open Options" / "Help" context menu items either won't surface or will behave differently. Verify whether the menus declarations are silently ignored or cause errors; either way the toolbar-icon flow and in-page links should remain the primary entry points.
- **Toolbar icon UX** — on Android the extension icon lives inside the browser menu rather than the toolbar, so the icon-click → options flow still works but the badge may not appear (Android doesn't show toolbar badges). Confirm and adjust expectations in the help docs if needed.
- **`gecko_android` declaration** in `browser_specific_settings.gecko_android` so Firefox for Android treats the extension as supported (currently only `gecko` is declared, which is desktop-only).
- **Testing** on an Android device or emulator before submission — manifest-only changes are risky to ship blind.

**Estimated effort:** Half a day for an acceptable port (mostly CSS + manifest), more for a polished one with Android-specific UX tweaks. Reasonable as a 1.1 follow-up after gathering any feedback from the 1.0 desktop submission.

## Domain Age Check (RDAP)

**Goal:** Catch typosquatting by flagging recently registered domains.

**Approach:** Query RDAP (free, standard HTTP/JSON protocol — e.g. `https://rdap.org/domain/<hostname>`) to retrieve the domain registration date, then display it as extra context on the block page alongside the existing character table. Not a blocking condition on its own — too noisy — just an informational signal for the user.

**Only run on already-flagged domains** to avoid adding latency to normal browsing. Cache results in `browser.storage.local` so repeat visits don't re-query.

**Concerns to address before implementing:**
- RDAP coverage gaps for some ccTLDs
- Rate limits on public RDAP servers
- The async lookup should not delay the block page render — fetch in parallel and update the page if/when the result arrives
- Consider making this an opt-in setting in the options page
